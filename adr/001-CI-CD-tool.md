# Title: Adopting GitHub Actions for CI/CD

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2023-07-30

## Context
There's a need for a reliable, scalable, and integrated CI/CD solution.
A proper CI/CD process can streamline our development process, ensuring code quality and automating deployments.

### Decision Drivers
- Integration with our current version control system (GitHub)
- Flexibility to handle both CI and CD tasks
- Easy configuration and maintenance
- Wide community support and continuous updates
- Support for matrix builds (testing on multiple platforms/versions)
- Transparent cost model

## Considered Options
- **Option 1**: Jenkins
    - Pros: Highly customizable, large plugin ecosystem
    - Cons: Requires dedicated infrastructure, steeper learning curve, maintenance overhead
- **Option 2**: CircleCI
    - Pros: Docker support, strong performance metrics
    - Cons: Limited free tier, configuration can become complex for larger projects
- **Option 3**: GitHub Actions
    - Pros: Seamless integration with GitHub repositories, flexible workflows, matrix builds, generous free tier for public repositories
    - Cons: Newer compared to other CI/CD tools (though maturing rapidly)

## Decision
Selected **Option 3 - GitHub Actions**, primarily due to its seamless integration with GitHub, which reduces the need for third-party integrations or context switching. The flexibility of its workflows and the wide community support make it an ideal choice for our project's current and future CI/CD needs.

## Consequences
- Reduced time spent on setting up and maintaining CI/CD infrastructure
- Enhanced developer experience due to integration within the GitHub ecosystem
- Easier onboarding for new contributors, as they will be familiar with the GitHub interface
- Dependency on GitHub's platform and any potential changes they make to Actions' features or pricing
