# Title: Adopting semantic-release for Automated Version Management and Changelog Generation

**Status**: Accepted

**Date**: 2023-07-30

## Context
it is essential to maintain a consistent versioning system and changelog.
This ensures clear communication to stakeholders about the changes in each release.
Automated version management and changelog generation can help streamline this process.

### Decision Drivers
- The need for consistent and semantic versioning.
- Automatic changelog generation to inform stakeholders of changes.
- Reducing manual errors in version bumping.
- Integration with existing CI/CD tools.

## Considered Options
- **Option 1**: Manual Versioning and Changelog Updates
    - Pros: Complete control over version numbers and changelog format.
    - Cons: Time-consuming, error-prone, lacks standardization.
- **Option 2**: Use of other versioning tools
    - Pros: Some level of automation.
    - Cons: Might not adhere to semantic versioning, lack of comprehensive changelog generation.
- **Option 3**: `semantic-release`
    - Pros: Fully automated version management, package publishing, adherence to semantic versioning, extensive plugins ecosystem, and continuous delivery support.
    - Cons: Relies on strict commit message conventions, initial configuration overhead.

## Decision
Selected **Option 3 - `semantic-release`**. Its full automation, adherence to semantic versioning,
extensive plugins ecosystem, and continuous delivery support make it a standout option for our project's needs.
The benefits of seamless integration with CI/CD tools and automatic changelog generation further enhance the development and release processes.

## Consequences
- Clearer, standardized versioning and changelog updates.
- Developers will need to follow semantic commit message guidelines.
- Enhanced integration with CI/CD tools for automatic releases and publishing.
- A potential learning curve for those unfamiliar with semantic versioning or `semantic-release` configuration.
